            <p>
              I have extensive experience developing both frontend and backend
              components in
              <strong>MERN stack projects</strong>, utilizing
              <strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong>, <strong>React.js</strong>, and
              <strong>Node.js (Express.js)</strong>. In my e-commerce projects,
              I implemented advanced features such as
              <strong>JWT-based authentication</strong> to secure user accounts,
              <strong>Stripe payment integration</strong> for handling
              transactions, and
              <strong>real-time chat functionality with Socket.IO</strong> to
              enhance user interaction. Additionally, I applied security
              measures like <strong>Helmet</strong> and
              <strong>XSS-Clean</strong> to protect applications from common
              vulnerabilities and attacks.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a <strong>tmbd films platform project</strong>, I designed and
              implemented RESTful APIs using <strong>Node.js</strong> and
              <strong>Express.js</strong>, performing data modeling with
              <strong>MongoDB</strong> and ensuring optimized query performance
              for handling large datasets. The frontend was built with
              <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong>, and
              <strong>React Router</strong>
              to provide a smooth, dynamic, and responsive user interface.
              Features included real-time notifications, post creation, user
              follow systems, and interactive comment threads.
            </p>

            <p>
              My <strong>computer vision projects</strong> involved using
              <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>OpenCV</strong>, and
              <strong>MediaPipe</strong> to create applications with advanced
              image and video processing capabilities. These projects include
              <strong>face detection and recognition</strong>,
              <strong>hand gesture tracking</strong> for interactive
              applications, and a <strong>sleep detection system</strong>
              that analyzes user behavior in real-time. These experiences
              strengthened my understanding of algorithms, machine learning
              concepts, and real-time data processing.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also have backend development experience using
              <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, where I created
              robust, scalable solutions with <strong>.NET Core</strong> and
              <strong>.NET Web API</strong>. These projects involved database
              integration, RESTful API design, authentication mechanisms, and
              the development of reusable modules to increase maintainability
              and efficiency in enterprise-level applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the frontend, I focus on building user-friendly, accessible,
              and responsive interfaces. I extensively use
              <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>,
              <strong>Bootstrap4</strong>, <strong>React.js</strong>,
              <strong>Redux</strong>, and <strong>Context API</strong> to ensure
              that applications are visually appealing, performant, and
              compatible across multiple devices. I also leverage
              <strong>React Router</strong> for seamless navigation and dynamic
              content rendering.
            </p>

            <p>
              My work with databases includes <strong>MongoDB</strong> for NoSQL
              solutions and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>
              for relational data storage. I am skilled in data modeling,
              writing efficient queries, and optimizing performance for both
              read and write operations. I ensure data integrity, indexing
              strategies, and scalability considerations are implemented in all
              projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my workflow, I consistently use <strong>Git/GitHub</strong> for
              version control, <strong>Postman</strong> for API testing, and
              development tools such as <strong>VS Code</strong>,
              <strong>Nodemon</strong>, <strong>Webpack</strong>,
              <strong>Babel</strong>, and <strong>npm/yarn</strong> for
              streamlined development, debugging, and deployment processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, I am expanding my expertise in
              <strong>React Native</strong> to develop cross-platform mobile
              applications, further deepening my knowledge in
              <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. I continue
              to explore modern application development best practices,
              implement scalable architectures, and stay updated with emerging
              technologies to deliver innovative and high-quality solutions.
